## Project Overview
This repository contains scripts used to (1) analyse and plot dopamine concentrations from Fast-scan Cyclic Voltammetry (FCV) experiments performed in _ex vivo_ mouse brain slices; (2) plot dopamine transients from patch-clamp experiments in _ex vivo_ mouse brain slices, and (3) determine the proximity of cell types using mathematical modelling. These scripts were custom-written and used in the study "Rapid modulation of striatal cholinergic interneurons and dopamine release by satellite astrocytes".

------------------
## Installation
These scripts use Phyton programming language and environment. Previous experience with Phyton or another programming language is required for efficient use of these scripts.

**Minimal system requirements for using these scripts.** This does not include hard-drive space required for additional software packages or dependencies.

------------------
## Folder Structure
The following folders are included in this repository:

**FCV**: Contains a README.md file and a script to analyse and plot dopamine concentrations from Fast-scan Cyclic Voltammetry (FCV) experiments performed in _ex vivo_ mouse brain slices.

**Patch-Clamp**: Contains a README.md file and a script to plot dopamine transients from patch-clamp experiments in _ex vivo_ mouse brain slices. 

**Mathematical Modelling**: Contains a README.md file and two scripts to model 2 and associated histogram described in the methods section of the associated study.
