## Project Overview
This repository contains scripts used to (1) analyse and plot dopamine concentrations from Fast-scan Cyclic Voltammetry (FCV) experiments performed in _ex vivo_ mouse brain slices; (2) plot dopamine transients from patch-clamp experiments in _ex vivo_ mouse brain slices, and (3) determine the proximity of cell types using mathematical modelling. These scripts were custom-written and used in the study ["Rapid modulation of striatal cholinergic interneurons and dopamine release by satellite astrocytes"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.15.594341v1).

## Folder Structure
The following folders are included in this repository:

**FCV**: Analysis of Fast-scan Cyclic Voltammetry (FCV) outputs.

**Patch-Clamp**: Plot transients from patch-clamp experiments. 

**Mathematical Modelling**: Model 2 and associated histograms described in the methods section of the associated study.
