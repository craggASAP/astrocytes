## Project Overview
This repository contains scripts used to (1) analyse and plot dopamine concentrations from Fast-scan Cyclic Voltammetry (FCV) experiments performed in _ex vivo_ mouse brain slices; (2) plot dopamine transients from patch-clamp experiments in _ex vivo_ mouse brain slices, and (3) determine the proximity of cell types using mathematical modelling. These scripts were custom-written and used in the study ["Rapid modulation of striatal cholinergic interneurons and dopamine release by satellite astrocytes"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.15.594341v1).

------------------
## System Requirements
Any computer using an operating system capable of running Python v3 and Jupyter Notebook, an interactive computational environment to manipulate and analyse data using Phyton. Alternatively, any computer with a web-browser and an internet connection with reasonable capacity (see Alternative Installation within the README.md file in the folder "Maths_Model")

**Hardware Requirements**
The computational power needed to run the python code should be well within the capacities of mid-range laptop computers, with, for example:

    * 8gb of RAM 
    * processor with 4 cores of 4.00+GHz 

**Software Requirements**
Python and Jupyter Notebook can be installed on machines running Windows, macOS or Linux. The latest version of Python can be downloaded from [python.org](python.org) which provides installers for the operating systems mentioned above. Jupyter Notebook can be downloaded from [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/search/?q=Jupyter).

------------------
## Folder Structure
The following folders are included in this repository:

**FCV**: Analysis of Fast-scan Cyclic Voltammetry (FCV) outputs.

**Patch-Clamp**: Plot transients from patch-clamp experiments. 

**Maths_Model**: Model 2 and associated histograms described in the methods section of the associated study.
