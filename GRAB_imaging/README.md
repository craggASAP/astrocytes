### GRAB ACh sensor imaging in _ex vivo_ mouse brain slices
------------------
## Installation

To install MATLAB on a macOS machine, you require a paid subscription from [MATLAB](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).

------------------
## Files

The following file is included in this folder:

**GRAB_Analysis.m**: Script to measure changes in fluorescence after each stimulation in _ex vivo_ mouse brain slices expressing GRAB ACh sensor.

**GRAB_Combined_Data.m**: Script to combine all processed data from each stimulation in an individual _ex vivo_ mouse brain slice. The output is a single excel spreadsheet.

**natsortfiles**: The natsortfiles function orders the files sequentially in excel, and the natsortfiles.m files must be open.
