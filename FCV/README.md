Runs the preprocessing and consequent analysis of raw .abf files obtained from fast-scan cyclic voltammetry experiments

Input:
	- Folder with raw .abf files named for example "2021_08_03_001.abf"
	- Calibration value

Output:
	 - PDF file with 'raw' voltammogram plots
	 - Processed .csv file named "'InverseDate'.'SliceNumber'.Data.csv" (similar to would come out of 		axoscope)
	 - PDF file with individual transients
	 - PDF file with aligned transients
	 - Processed .csv file named "'InverseDate'.'SliceNumber'.DataProcessed.csv
