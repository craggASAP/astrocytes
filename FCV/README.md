### Fast-scan Cyclic Voltammetry experiments in _ex vivo_ mouse brain slices
------------------
## Installation
To install Jupyter Notebook on a macOS machine, download the Jupyter metapackage from [Phyton Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/).

------------------
## Demonstration

**Instructions for use**

This Pythin script uses raw .abf files and calibration values as input files. The .abf files can be named "2021_08_03_001.abf". After running the code, five output files will be generated:

* PDF file with 'raw' voltammogram plots;
* Processed .csv file named "'InverseDate'.'SliceNumber'.Data.csv" (similar to would come out of axoscope);
* PDF file with individual transients;
* PDF file with aligned transients;
* Processed .csv file named "'InverseDate'.'SliceNumber'.DataProcessed.csv

## Files
The following file is included in this folder:

**FCV_Complete_Analysis_Code.ipynb**: Code to analyse and plot dopamine concentrations obtained from Fast-scan Cyclic Voltammetry experiments in _ex vivo_ mouse brain slices.
