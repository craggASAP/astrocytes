### Patch-Clamp experiments in _ex vivo_ mouse brain slices
------------------
## Installation
To install Jupyter Notebook on a macOS machine, download the Jupyter metapackage from [Phyton Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/).

------------------
## Demonstration

**Instructions for use**
This Python script uses raw .abf files as input files. The .abf files can be named "2021_08_03_001.abf". After running the code, an image (and if needed, a .csv file) will be generated for a given electrophysiological recording.

## Files
The following file is included in this folder:

**PatchClamp_Plots_Code.ipynb**: Code to plot electrophysiological traces obtained from Patch-Clamp experiments in _ex vivo_ mouse brain slices.
