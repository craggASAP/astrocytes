System requirements
--------------------------
Any computer using an operating system capable of running Python 3, or alternatively, any computer with a web-browser and an internet connection with reasonable capacity (see "alternative requirements" below).

### Hardware requirements ###
The computational power needed to run the python code should be well within the capacities of mid-range laptop computers, with, for example:

    * 8gb of RAM 
    * processor with 4 cores of 4.00+GHz 

### Software requirements ###

Python can be installed on machines running Windows, macOS or Linux. The latest version of Python can be downloaded from [python.org](python.org) which provides installers for the operating systems mentioned above.
